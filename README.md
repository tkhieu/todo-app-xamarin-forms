# Overview

A small application to demo how to structure and architect a MAUI application. Alternatively, you can check out [Chick and Paddy MAUI sample app](https://github.com/tuyen-vuduc/chick-and-paddy-dotnet-maui).

**NOTE:** 

- This project used to be a template for Xamarin.Forms applications. You can check out [v1.0-xf](https://github.com/tuyen-vuduc/todo-app-xamarin-forms/releases/tag/v1.0-xf) if you still look for a Xamarin.Forms app template. 
- Thanks a lot to [David Ortinau](https://github.com/davidortinau) to migrate the project to [MAUI and .NET7](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/maui/what-is-maui).

# UI Design
The app is built based on [the UI design](https://dribbble.com/shots/14100356-ToDo-App-UI) by [Alex Arutuynov](https://dribbble.com/alex_arutuynov)
